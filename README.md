# 🌤️ Weather CLI App

A simple yet powerful **Command-Line Weather App** built in Python using the OpenWeatherMap API.  
This tool lets you check the **current weather** and **5-day forecast** for any city in real time — all from your terminal!

## 📌 Description

This CLI app fetches real-time weather data and a daily summary forecast for the next 5 days.  
It uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather details such as:

- Current temperature  
- Weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy)  
- Humidity percentage  
- Wind speed  
- Forecast with daily highlights

All data is displayed in a clean and readable format via the terminal — no GUI required.
